Topology and coordinate files for simulation of Tween 20 with NAMD using MARTINI force Field


The files provided here correspond to the atomistic model of the molecule and the conversion to Martini model using VMD
Note that the CG Martini coordinates need further optimization/energy minimization as described in the paper.
